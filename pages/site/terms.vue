          <p class="text-body-1 font-weight-bold">MONETIZATION</p>
          <p>
            Qualified Submissions (defined below) may be monetized by a user.
            Using web monetization, a user who wishes to monetize their
            Submission (“Monetization”), subject to all terms of this Agreement
            and the limitations below, may be paid per Coil’s applicable rate
            (“Monetization Rate”). More information about Coil’s applicable
            payment rate can be found here. (valid as of 5/11/2021) For the
            purpose of Monetization, ‘Qualified Submission’ means Submission
            that meets the terms and conditions hereunder, meets Coils Terms of
            Service, that is posted on MG.Social, with monetization turned on,
            by a Qualified User and that is made available to other users. For
            purposes of Monetization, ‘Qualified User’ means a user with a valid
            MG.Social Account and a paid Coil subscription per Coil’s Terms,
            with properly configured monetization settings as described in this
            section. Users may only monetize Qualified Submissions when posting
            their own original, or otherwise lawfully used content. Monetization
            is available only for views of Monetized posts by users with a paid
            Coil subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we can pay you, you must have a valid and active wallet
            registered at one of Uphold or GateHub services and you must
            successfully complete Coil’s payment enrollment process. All
            monetization generated by an Account Holder prior to providing the
            required information of a valid and active wallet to Coil shall be
            forfeited. All monetization generated by an Account Holder when any
            wallet provided to Coil by that Account Holder is invalid or
            inactive shall be forfeited. No payment will be made for any
            Submission that violates any of the provisions of this Agreement,
            including any Submission that is identified as potentially
            infringing the rights of any third party. Your acceptance of this
            Agreement does not guarantee access to Monetization. MG.Social
            reserves the right to provide or restrict your access to the
            Monetization in its sole discretion at any time. MG.Social may block
            Monetization in your Submission for any or no reason, even if the
            Submission otherwise complies with MG.Social’s terms or policies.
            Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, there are no
            representations, warranties or guarantees, express or implied, about
            how much, or whether, you will receive payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            All monetization payment shall be made directly to your wallet by
            Coil using ILP (Interledger Protocol). For more information on such
            payments, please see Coil’s or Interledger’s websites. You shall
            provide the address for your Uphold or GateHub wallets to Coil to
            ensure monetization payment is made. MG.Social will take
            commercially reasonable steps to monitor the Monetization payment
            moving from Coil to a user and allow the user to see how much
            monetization payment they have received. For any Qualified
            Submission in which you trigger Monetization, MG.Social will pay you
            the Net Revenue (defined below) derived from such Qualified
            Submission as solely determined by MG.Social. “Net Revenue” means
            (a) the sum of the Monetization Rate multiplied by the number of
            views per second of the Qualified Users who viewed your Submission,
            minus (b) deductions for any fraud or other legal violations,
            violations of MG.Social’s terms or policies, bad debt, chargebacks,
            refunds, credit card processing fees, and any third party fees and
            costs (such as but not limited to payments to third party rights
            holders in your Submission), or any other deduction all as solely
            determined from MG.Social’s records and figures and regardless of
            whether incurred in connection with the specific Qualified
            Submission or your other Submission in which Monetization is
            triggered Subject to Agreement and provided that you have accurately
            completed and timely provided to Coil or MG.Social any forms or
            documentation that Coil or MG.Social requests to set up payment to
            you (which payment information you must keep accurate and
            up-to-date) provided that you have the requisite authority to
            provide such information, payments will be made to you in accordance
            with this Agreement and the terms of service of Coil. If your
            account with MG.Social is deactivated or terminated, you forfeit any
            accrued amounts. MG.Social reserves the right to deduct from any
            payments due or payable to you any amounts that are past due and
            remain uncollected by MG.Social from you in connection with any
            other MG.Social Service. MG.Social is not responsible for, and will
            not adjudicate, any disputes between you and any other entity
            relating to (a) the payment information that you provide to Coil or
            (b) the payment or any apportionment of the payment between you and
            any third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to Monetization, MG.Social allows user to tip certain
            Submissions using Xumm. Subject to Agreement, specifically
            PROHIBITED USES and THIRD PARTY MATERIALS, and subject to Xumm’s
            Terms of Service users may use the Service’s Xumm integration to
            send tips to other MG.Social users.
