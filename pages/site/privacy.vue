            WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to provide our services, we collect information. Some
            information you provide directly to us, some we collect
            automatically through our Platform, and some may be collected from
            third parties. Some of the information we collect will be personally
            identifiable information, which is information that identifies you,
            or can be combined with other data, to identify you as a specific
            individual.
          </p>

          <p class="font-weight-bold">
            We Collect Information you Provide to Us
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, we collect information when you use a service on the
            Platform, create an account, fill out a form, request customer
            service, or otherwise communicate with us. For payments to and from
            MG.Social, we use third party service providers including but not
            limited to Coil, Uphold, GateHub, and Xumm. Refer to the applicable
            third party service provider's privacy policies (for example: Coil’s
            Privacy Policy) to see what data they collect and how it is used.
            Data collected from Coil is provided “as is” and no guarantee is
            made of the availability of any information, data, functionality, or
            feature provided. For the purposes of this Policy, ‘Data’ means
            certain data about Coil users from Coil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of the types of personal information you may provide
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Contact information (such as name, email address, mailing address,
              and phone number);
            </li>

            <li>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            We may also collect other information from or about you, such as
            information about what services you used, your interests, and
            demographic information.
