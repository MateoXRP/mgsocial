            <strong>MG Social: Web Monetized Social Network Platform</strong>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            We are proud to announce the launch of
            <a href="https://mg.social">MG Social</a>, a new social network with
            web monetization powered by <a href="https://coil.com">Coil</a> and
            <a href="https://xumm.app/">Xumm</a>.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The MG in our name stands for Monetized Gram.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>mon·e·tize -</strong> earn revenue from (an asset, business,
            etc.).
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong>gram -</strong> something written down, drawn, or recorded
            (telegram, electrocardiogram etc.).
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Traditionally the business model for social media has consisted of a
            company (Twitter, Facebook etc.) providing a service (the social
            network) to their user base, and funding their operations from the
            revenue gained by the selling of user data to advertisers. The end
            user ends up not being a customer of the social network but the
            product being sold.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            At MG Social we think differently. We have incorporated cutting edge
            web monetization software within our social network to allow for an
            entirely new business model. Our social network rewards creators for
            the content they create as it is viewed by other subscribers in real
            time using streaming micro-payments. At MG Social your data will
            never be sold to advertisers.
          </p>

            All that is required is a $5 monthly subscription to Coil. For a
            list of other sites and services a Coil subscription grants you
            access to click
            <a href="https://coil.com/explore" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Having a Coil subscription as a requirement will allow MG Social to
            fund and scale operation of the platform ad-free. It will help
            ensure MG Social users are interacting with real live human beings,
            not bot or troll accounts. It also ensures posted content will
            always be monetized when viewed by other subscribers on the site.
          </p>
